aspects of project that need to be worked out

validation
  analytic
    solve two body problem
      taylors mechanics (p293, pdf308)
    convert cartesian to reduced mass and vice versa
    come up with function starts with initial condition at T=0, returns T=whenever
    compare simulated results
    decide on metric
  observational
    download some number of days/years of observed data for solar system
    convert mks units into G=1 units
    decide on comparison metric and write subroutine

interface
  drawing
    setting gray scale values on grid
    calculating center of mass quickly
    turning that into intial mass distribution
  options
    build sliders
      sliders for mass used (not user controllable)
      sliders for initial angular kinetic energy, user decidable

algorithm
  accuracy
    use newton's method (N^2) against validation tests
    use RK45 (N^2) against validation tests and newtons method
  speed
    coming up with test cases for quad tree
    building quad tree using x-y
    building oct tree using x-y-z
    building tree with z-order curves and morton codes
    use newton's method (NlnN) against validation tests
    use RK45 (NlnN) against validation tests and newtons method

acceleration
  implement part or all with parallel.js
  if not an option in javascript, see how hard it would be to execute some of the solved aspects in python.
